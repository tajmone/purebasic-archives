Introduction
============

-   <https://github.com/tajmone/purebasic-archives>

This repo was created by Tristano Ajmone ([@tajmone](https://github.com/tajmone)) as a centralized place for gathering and sharing PureBASIC-realted resources: code examples and snippets, libraries, tutorials, books, and links — anything that can simplify a programmer’s life by either being herein archived or linked/reviewed.

Resources Organization
======================

The Archives project is divided into folders according to categories:

-   [`/books/`](./books/) — books on PureBASIC programming.
-   [`/syntax-highlighting/`](./syntax-highlighting/) — publishing PureBASIC source code in colored syntax.
-   [`/text-editors/`](./text-editors/) — PureBASIC syntax support in text editors.

Some folders contain material specific to this repo’s developement and maintainance:

-   [`/repo-maintainance-tools/`](./repo-maintainance-tools/) — scripts related to the maintainance of this repository.

License
=======

This is a collection of various resources, and each resource comes with its own license. Please read carefully the licenses terms on a per-resource basis before incorporating them into your projects.

Nothing has been incorporated here that would prevent cloning this repository. As for the project in itself — ie: its structure, and my personal contributions in terms of documentations and project-related resources — its to be considered as released into the public domain according to the Unlicense terms (see: [Unlicense.org](http://unlicense.org/)).

About PureBASIC
===============

PureBASIC is a commercial programming language and IDE published by Fantaisie Software (France):

-   https://www.purebasic.com/

> PureBasic is a native 32-bit and 64-bit programming language based on established BASIC rules. The key features of PureBasic are portability (Windows, Linux and MacOS X are currently supported), the production of very fast and highly optimized executables and, of course, the very simple BASIC syntax. PureBasic has been created for the beginner and expert alike. We have put a lot of effort into its realization to produce a fast, reliable system friendly language.
>
> In spite of its beginner-friendly syntax, the possibilities are endless with PureBasic’s advanced features such as pointers, structures, procedures, dynamically linked lists and much more. Experienced coders will have no problem gaining access to any of the legal OS structures or API objects and PureBasic even allows inline ASM.
