*Assembly Language Adventures*, by xorpd, is a complete FASM Assembly course purchasable at Udemy website for a very reasonable price — $20 if you buy the course from the author’s site (which offers a discount coupon) or around $30 if you purchase it on Udemy website.

It consists of 118 lectures, with 29 hours of video course, PDF documents, and the source code files of the course examples.

Having purchased and taken this course myself, I strongly advise it to anyone interested in learning Assembly — and especially if you are planning to use Assembly with PureBASIC, since PureBASIC relies on FASM assembler.

The course is designed for total beginners and experts alike: no prior programming knowledge is assumed. The author guides you step by step into the language and its tools, until you are ready to carry on by yourself. He doesn’t just teach you Assembly: he shows you the tools of the trade, and how to use them; and most importantly, he teaches you were to find all the information you’ll need once the course is over and you become independent.

The course exercises are freely availabe on GitHub, where they are actively maintained by the author:

-   <https://github.com/xorpd/asm_prog_ex>

The course, its examples and exercise are for Windows OS, but the author has also made available on GitHub a Linux port of the exercises for Yasm assembler:

The example files that come with the course are also available on GitHub:
